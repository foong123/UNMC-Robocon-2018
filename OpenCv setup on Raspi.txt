Hello all. In this text file we will be teaching on how to setup OpenCv on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B

1) Get Raspberry Pi 3 Model and install the latest raspbian ( in my case will be Stretch)
2) Go to this website: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/09/04/raspbian-stretch-install-opencv-3-python-on-your-raspberry-pi/
3) Follow step 1 of the website. 

If your Raspi is using an 8GB Mirco SD card, I suggest to change to a bigger storage (eg 16-32 GB)

4) Follow step 2 & 3. 
5) At step 4, please pay attention of this step. This is important as you need to decide whether you want to install your 
   virtual environment in python 2.7 or python 3. 
   If you want to use python 2.7 use mkvirtualenv cv -p python2
   If you want to use python 3 use mkvirtualenv cv -p python3

6) Continue with step 4. 
7) Follow Step 5. Make sure when compiling and installing OpenCV it is inside the virtual environment. 
8) During the make process you can use raspi single cores by typing "make". If you to use all 4 cores of raspi, 
   be sure to increase the swap space size or your raspi will restart.
   The difference between single core and quad core is:
   a) Quad core compile OpenCV faster than single core. (Quad core take around 2 hours while single core around 4 hours)  
   b) Raspi will be very hot usig Quad core compare to single core.
   c) Quad core may have some issues with overheating and compiling will fail.

9) Follow Step 6&7 and be sure to change the swap space size (if you are using quad core) to 100MB or your
   raspi will have some issues with memory in the future.



Some important library to take note:

1) "pip install matplotlib"
    This library had some issues with the latest version with stretch. I suggest you roll back to version 2.1.0
    In the terminal: "pip install matplotlib == 2.1.0"
