Hello all. In this text I will show you how to pull and push. 

Pulling

1) Get a GitHub account and follow the user foong123
2) Inform me once follow via Whatapps or email and I will add you as contributors.
3) Open cmd and type "cd Desktop"
4) Then type "mkdir <your folder name>".   In my case I type "mkdir Robocon".
5) Key in "cd <your folder name>"
6) type "git init"
7) type "git remote add origin https://github.com/foong123/UNMC-Robocon-2018.git"
8) key "git pull origin <your branch that you will be working>"
   E.g. if you are working on Launching key in "git pull origin Launching"
   This will pull the launching branch into that folder
9) To change branch key in "git checkout <branch available on the repo>"
10) To know which branch you are using type "git status"


Pushing

When you have done your task in Robocon and you need to push them on GitHub,

1) Open cmd and type "cd Desktop" and then "cd <your folder name>"
2) Before you push check your branch that you are on ( use git status to check)
3) Once checked, key "git add ."
4) Then "git commit -m "<your Message>" " Be sure that your message contains "" and 
   says what you added/updated for your pushing. 
5) type "git push origin <current branch you working>"
6) Go to GitHub and check your branch and you will see it is updated.
